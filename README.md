### Hi, there! :fish: :thought_balloon:

I'm [Nurullah](http://nurullahgngr.com/), a software developer from Turkey.

I'm primarily interested in **full-stack development** and currently work as a freelance back-end developer.

Outside of work, I'm interested in self-improvement, philosophy and paint dystopian surrealism. I also play a lot of video games and feeding wild animals in terrarium made by self.
